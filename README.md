# Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2
Raylib C++ Starter Template for Visual Studio Code on Windows.
It works with raylib version 5.0. Tested on both Windows 10 and Windows 11.

# How to use this template
1. Double click on the main.code-workspace file. This will open the template in VS Code.
2. From the Explorer Window of VS Code navigate to the src folder and double click on the main.cpp file.
3. Press F5 on the keyboard to compile and run the program.

# What's changed
The template now uses folders for better organizion of the files. So, all the source code now lives in the src folder.
